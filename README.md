# Swift8

Swift8 is a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter written in Swift. 

The technical document used writing the system can be found [here](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).

## ROMS

Multiple games have been written for the CHIP-8 platform and are in the public domain. A number of these can be found on [DopeRoms](http://www.doperoms.com/roms/Chip-8.html). These include Space Invaders, Pong, Tetris and more.

## Remarks
This is my first attempt to emulate any system, for now I am still working on it. And hopefully one day it will actually be able to run any of the fore-mentioned ROMS.
