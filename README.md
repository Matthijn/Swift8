# Swift8

Swift8 is a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter written in Swift for OSX 10.10+. 

The technical document used writing the system can be found [here](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM). More comprehensive information can be found [here](http://laurencescotford.co.uk/?p=242).

## ROMS

Multiple games have been written for the CHIP-8 platform and are in the public domain. Roms can be be found on the internet on for example [DopeRoms](http://www.doperoms.com/roms/Chip-8.html). These include Space Invaders, Pong, Tetris and more. A number of these ROMS can be found in the roms folder.

## Keys

The original systems used an [Hexadecimal Keyboard](http://laurencescotford.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/COSMAC-VIP-keypad-layout.gif). The keys are mapped to:

```
1234
qwer
asdf
zxcv
```
